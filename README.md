#Project: 	Process Manager 

##Author: Yao-Chin (Jonathan) Liu

## Objectives- To create a program with the ability to log and manage bioinformatic pipelines (or other processes).

##Context:	 A multitude of bioinformatics programs are needed to gather sufficient data for analysis of samples. Manually running and logging these programs is tedious, and may lead to errors after many repetitions. A program could automate this otherwise boring task.

##Features: 	1) Able to find scripts (bash and python by default) in a given folder 2) Can create an option list of processes that can be run 3) Is able to run the programs sequentially 4) Will create a log file detailing what scripts were run at what time

##Status:	Complete

##Possible future directions:	1) Can specify the input and output files of the processes run	2) Can find processes at a selected range (potentially up to within the whole computer) 3) Can designate which part of the processes/programs to be run	4) Will display the % status of current process	5) Make Graphical User Interface more aesthetically pleasing
